##### MAYBE NECESSARY, I kinda like the singletons approach to things.... #####
Re-factor code to be cleaner
	Clean up pointers better
	Create more functions
	Be rid of singletons!!
Remember to clean up, and add release functions to all your systems (especially resource manager)
Fix smol leak in input manager ( might just be SDL2 allocating enough memory, seems to plateau with time)

##### MAYBE NECESSARY, I kinda like the singletons approach to things.... #####
Re-factor code to be cleaner
	Clean up pointers better
	Create more functions
	Be rid of singletons!!
Remember to clean up, and add release functions to all your systems (especially resource manager)
Fix smol leak in input manager ( might just be SDL2 allocating enough memory, seems to plateau with time)


Filthy Notes:
Object instantiation

Better script system to support not needing to add a bunch of hardcoded jazz into other code

Better inspector to support public variable changing & saving of all public variables

object A collides with object B, but object B does not collide with object A

position component translates by int

rework of scene required to not depend on "components.h"

no 'save scene' button
